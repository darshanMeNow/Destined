# Destined
Whenever we travels to other cities, we need to call friend/family to know about our location. I repeat, we call just to update our location. What if any helper app do this 
simple task.
This is where Destined comes into picture.

Overview of the project: 
  You have to enter some checkpoints (Sequentially as you will travel) where you would like to notify family when you reach.
  Our app will continously checking your current location
  and will update list automatically and notifys other family users about the location.
  
  So, your taks is done.
    1. You don't need to call
    2. They will not track you (Why family should spy you?)
    3. They are notified about your location
    
    WIN! WIN!
